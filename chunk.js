/*
The task is to take an array arr and a chunk size size as input, and return a chunked array. The chunked array should contain subarrays of length size, formed from the elements of the original array arr. The last subarray may have a length less than size if the length of arr is not evenly divisible by size.

Use Cases:
Pagination:

When implementing pagination in a web application, you often need to split a large list of items into smaller chunks or pages. The chunking operation allows you to divide the items into manageable portions, making it easier to display and navigate through the data.
In the example usage, let's say we have an array of 10 items and want to display 3 items per page. We specify the current page number as 2. The function will be called with these parameters, and the resulting chunked array (representing the items for the second page) should be logged to the console.
function paginateArray(array, pageSize, pageNumber) {
// Calculate the starting index of the current page
const startIndex = (pageNumber - 1) * pageSize;

// Create a chunk of the array based on the page size
const chunkedArray = array.slice(startIndex, startIndex + pageSize);

return chunkedArray;
}

// Example usage
const data = [
'Racoon 1', 'Racoon 2', 'Racoon 3', 'Racoon 4', 'Racoon 5',
'Racoon 6', 'Racoon 7', 'Racoon 8', 'Racoon 9', 'Racoon 10'
];

const pageSize = 3; // Number of items per page
const pageNumber = 2; // Current page number

const result = paginateArray(data, pageSize, pageNumber);
console.log(result);
Parallel Processing:

In parallel computing or distributed systems, data is often divided into chunks and processed simultaneously by multiple processors or nodes. Chunking the data allows for efficient distribution and parallel execution of tasks, improving overall performance.
Image Processing:

In image processing applications, large images are often divided into smaller blocks or tiles to enable processing and analysis at a more granular level. Each tile can be independently processed, allowing for parallelization and efficient utilization of computational resources.
Data Analysis and Aggregation:

When dealing with large datasets, it can be beneficial to divide the data into smaller chunks for analysis and aggregation purposes. This approach allows for parallel or distributed processing, enabling faster data processing and efficient resource utilization.
File Upload and Transfer:

When uploading or transferring large files, the data is typically sent in smaller chunks to handle potential network limitations and ensure reliable delivery. The receiving end can process each chunk independently and reassemble them to reconstruct the original file.
Approach 1: Using Brute Force
Intuition:
we can use nested while loops to iterate through the input array and form chunks of the specified size. The outer loop can control the index of the input array, while the inner loop can add elements to a temporary array until the desired chunk size is reached or the end of the input array is reached. Then the temporary array can be added to the chunked array. This process continues until all elements are processed.

Algorithm:
Initialize the chunkedArray as an empty array.
We use a while loop with the condition i < arr.length to iterate through the array.
In each iteration, a temp array is created to hold the elements of each chunk.
Use a nested while loop with the condition len-- > 0 && i < arr.length to add elements to the temp array.
Check if the end of the array is reached while adding elements to temp to handle the last chunk.
Now add the temp array as a subarray to the chunkedArray.
Return the chunkedArray. In summary: It uses nested while loops to iterate through the array and form chunks.
Implementation:

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(n), Where n is the length or size of the input array.

Space Complexity: O(n), Where n is the length or size of the input array.

Approach 2: Using Slicing
Intuition:
We can use the slice method to extract a chunk of the input array based on the current index and the specified size. The slice method creates a shallow copy of the portion of the array starting from the current index up to the current index plus the chunk size. The chunk is then added to the chunked array, and the index is incremented by the chunk size. This process continues until all elements are processed.

Algorithm:
We can iterate through the array using a while loop.
After iterating add the sliced chunk to the chunkedArray using arr.slice(index, index + size).
Now increment the index by the size after each iteration.
After incrementing continue until the end of the array is reached.
Finally, return the chunkedArray. In summary: We can use the slice method to extract chunks from the array based on the index and size.
Implementation:

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(n), Where n is the length or size of the input array.

Space Complexity: O(1).

Approach 3: Using Splice and Slice
Intuition:
we can use nested loops to iterate through the input array and form chunks. The outer loop increments the index by the chunk size, while the inner loop adds elements to a temporary array by using the splice method. If the end of the input array is reached, the remaining elements in the temporary array are removed using splice. The temporary array is then added to the chunked array. After the loops end, the first empty subarray in the chunked array is removed using slice(1).

Algorithm:
Initialize the chunkedArray as an array containing an empty subarray [[]].
Maintain a temporary array temp to hold the elements of each chunk.
Outer loop iterates over the array starting from j and increments by size.
Inner loop iterates over the current chunk size size and adds elements to the temp array using arr[j + i].
Now check if the end of the array is reached while adding elements to temp and uses temp.splice(j) to remove any remaining elements in temp.
Now add the temp array as a subarray to the chunkedArray using the spread operator [...b, [...a]].
Finally return the chunkedArray with the first empty subarray removed using b.slice(1). In summary: Uses splice and slice and while loop to iterate through the array and form chunks.
Implementation:

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(n^2), Where n is the length or size of the input array.

Space Complexity: O(n), Where n is the length or size of the input array.

Approach 4: Using Reduce
Intuition:
In this method we use the reduce function to iterate over the input array and build the chunked array. The reduce function takes an initial value of an empty array ([]) and a callback function. The callback function checks the last chunk in the chunked array. If the last chunk doesn't exist or its length is equal to the chunk size, a new chunk is created with the current element. Otherwise, the current element is added to the last chunk. The updated chunked array is returned in each iteration.

Algorithm:
Initialize the chunkedArray as an empty array.
In each iteration of the reduce function:
Checks the last chunk in the chunkedArray using chunkedArray[chunkedArray.length - 1].
If the last chunk doesn't exist or its length is equal to the size:
Create a new chunk chunk with the current element and adds it to the chunkedArray.
Otherwise:
Append the current element to the last chunk.
Finally return the final chunkedArray. In summary: It uses the reduce function to iterate over the array and build the chunkedArray.
Implementation:

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(n), Where n is the length or size of the input array.

Space Complexity: O(1).

Approach 5: Using Push
Intuition:
In this method we iterate through the input array using a for...of loop. It maintains a currentChunk array to hold the elements of the current chunk. When the currentChunk reaches the desired size, it is added to the result array, and a new currentChunk is created. At the end of the loop, any remaining elements in the currentChunk are added to the result array if it is not empty.

Algorithm:
Maintain a result array to hold the chunkedArray.
We use a currentChunk array to store the elements of the current chunk being constructed.
For each element in the array:
If the currentChunk reaches the desired size:
Push the currentChunk to the result array.
Create a new currentChunk and adds the element to it.
Otherwise, appends the element to the currentChunk.
If there are any leftover elements in the currentChunk, they are added to the result array.
Finally return the result array. In summary: It iterates through the array using a for...of loop and uses push method for pushing chunks.
Implementation:

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(n), Where n is the length or size of the input array.

Space Complexity: O(n), Where n is the length or size of the input array.

Approach 6: Using Ceiling
Intuition:
In this method, we use the Array.from method to create a new array based on the number of chunks needed, which is determined by dividing the length of the input array by the chunk size and rounding up using Math.ceil. The Array.from method also accepts a mapping function that creates each chunk by using slice to extract the corresponding portion of the input array based on the index and chunk size.

Algorithm:
We use Array.from to create an array of length equal to the number of chunks.
Now map each element of the new array using a callback function that creates each chunk.
The callback function uses arr.slice(index * size, index * size + size) to extract the corresponding portion of the array for each chunk.
Finally return the resulting chunked array. In summary: It determines the number of chunks needed using Math.ceil(arr.length / size).
Implementation:

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(n), Where n is the length or size of the input array

Space Complexity: O(1)

Interview Tips:
What is the purpose of chunking an array?

Chunking an array allows us to divide a large array into smaller, more manageable subarrays. This can be useful in various scenarios such as pagination, parallel processing, or dividing data for distributed systems.
How would you approach chunking an array without using built-in library functions like _.chunk?

One approach is to use loops and array manipulation techniques. Another approach is to utilize the slice or splice methods to extract chunks of the array. Alternatively, you can use the reduce function to iterate over the array and create subarrays of the desired size.
Can you explain the difference between chunking an array and splitting an array?

Chunking an array involves dividing it into smaller subarrays of equal or specified size, while splitting an array typically involves separating it into two or more separate arrays at a given index or based on a condition.
How would you handle edge cases where the array length is not evenly divisible by the chunk size?

In such cases, the last subarray may have a length that is less than the specified chunk size. This can be handled by checking the remaining elements and including them in the last subarray.
